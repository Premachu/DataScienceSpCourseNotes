If we have 30 HP, how many steps can we take? \n\n* **Algebra**\n    * Flip, and destroy\n    * $5/2 = 30/x$\n    * \n    \n    \n* **multiplication**\n\n\n## Statistics [tut1](http://mathbench.umd.edu/modules/visualization_log-transformations/page04.htm)   [tut2](http://www.biostathandbook.com/transformation.html)   [Rtut](http://www.r-statistics.com/2013/05/log-transformations-for-skewed-and-wide-distributions-from-practical-data-science-with-r/)\n\n* **Log Transformations**\n    * Data differs by orders of magitude (10, 100, 1000, 10000)\n    * To make modelling easier and appearance on graph nicer, log transform\n    * Make skewed data normally distributed\n    * Makes patterns more visible\n    \n## Basic Geometry\n\n### Scale Drawings\n\nPeter just buried a treasure chest on a remote island and is making a map so he can find it later. One of the key landmarks in the area is a small rectangular hut, 5m by 8m.  \n\nThe map's scale is 2 units: 1m. Help him draw...\n\n * Convert 5m into units\n    * $5 ~m~ * ~2~ units / 1 m$\n    * 5 ~~m~~ * 2 units / 1 ~~m~~\n    * $= 10 units$\n * Convert 8m into units\n    * $8m * 2 units / 1 m$\n    * 8 ~~m~~ * 2 units / 1 ~~m~~\n    * $= 16 units$\n \n \n    ",
